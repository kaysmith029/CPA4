Food Link is an app that aims to categorize your food as you buy it. Whether you enter it manually or scan the item's barcode. You never have to bring a list to the store again with this app in hand. Say goodbye to remembering best by dates! We have you covered.

Screen shots are located in github readME. 

For this app I used JSON, stack naviagator, and npm.
